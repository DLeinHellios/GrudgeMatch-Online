## GrudgeMatch-Online

FGC Website concept build in Python and Flask, styled in Bootstrap. Envisioned as a home for locals, players, and events, GrudgeMatch Online would serve as a central hub for the fighting game community. TOs would have a place to submit their local, manage and promote their events, and view player information. Players would be able to link their various accounts to build a unified profile from their growth and achievements within the community. Currently only a UI mockup.
